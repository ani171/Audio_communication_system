# audio_communication_system

This project focuses on creating a real-time audio communication system using a client-server architecture. The server listens for incoming connections, handles multiple client connections concurrently, and facilitates communication between clients. Clients, when connected, can send and receive audio data, allowing for real-time voice communication. The system uses the socket library for network communication and threading to manage multiple client connections simultaneously.
